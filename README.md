The research project aimed to develop an Android malware detection system using machine learning algorithms. 
The dataset used in the project was obtained from the Drebin website and consisted of uncleaned APKs (Android application packages).
The dataset included malicious files and Google apps for clean APKs.

One of the key aspects of the project was the use of wave format files derived from the APKs. 
The APKs were converted into wave files for analysis and feature extraction. 
Three different types of wave files were compared for their effectiveness in representing the characteristics of the APKs:

MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
BFCC (Bark Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
NGCC (Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)

The project utilized a total of 9 machine learning algorithms for malware detection.
These algorithms were selected based on their suitability for classification tasks and their performance in previous studies related to malware detection.

The main objectives of the research project were:

To develop a robust feature extraction method using wave format files from APKs.
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of MFCC, BFCC, and NGCC wave files in representing APK characteristics.
To implement and evaluate 9 machine learning algorithms for Android malware detection.
To assess the performance of the developed system in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
The findings of the research project were expected to contribute to the field of Android malware detection by providing insights into 
effective feature extraction techniques and the performance of various machine learning algorithms in this domain.
